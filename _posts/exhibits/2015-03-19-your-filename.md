## Melinda

Way back when I had this friend, her name was Melinda. 


She was really cool and we always played with our pet cows after school. So the story is, that one afternoon Melinda and I were walking up my gravel driveway and we came past my cow lying on the ground… just lying there obviously fucking dead. I 100% reacted like any other 13 year old child would went off my nut, crying like there was no tomorrow ( for me at the time there was no tomorrow, because my cow just fucking died!!! ) Wait it gets better! While I was crying my eyes out, she ( Melinda ) is on her mother fucking phone because apparently some shit program called “Disney” or what ever the fuck its called, wanted that bitch Meee-fucking-punk-ass-linda on their new show “Hannah Mon-fucking-tanna.” TTTTHAT BITCH! She was sooooo fucking happy she ran right past me to go home and tell her slaggy parents the “good news”. EVEN BETTER!!! ,10 years later she’s sooooome famous bitch! Well you know what!!! I have a farm and its a really good farm, and I have all the friends in the world, Hay, Bay, and ill. You’re a dirty hoe (not the tool FYI) 


O yeah by the way it was me who killed your cow bitch!!!
