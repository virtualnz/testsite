## Pieces of paper

I lived in Manchuria during the war when I was about five years old. I don’t remember much clearly; my mother told me this story many years later when I was an adult. 
<br><br>
Manchuria was at the time occupied by the Japanese army. The region used the Manchurian yen as the official currency until the Russians came in and set up base. They chose the biggest hotel in the main street and made it their headquarters. They used to throw out bagfuls of cabbage leaves every week, since they’d only ever seen cabbage sprouts. The Russians weren’t detested; most of our neighbours lived off those discarded leaves. The only other change that occurred was that their Russian currency was put in place, along with the Manchurian yen.
<br><br>
Just as the people were getting used to the new money, the Chinese Communist Party overthrew the Russians. The cabbage leaves were no more but the Russian money stayed, since although the Chinese Communists insisted on using their own currency, it was a hassle having to change everything. So a compromise was reached; to have all three currencies valid within Manchuria.  
<br><br>
All was well, save for a few weeks of confusion and getting used to on the citizens’ behalf, until the Chinese National Party backed by the Americans forced their way into Manchuria.
<br><br>
As expected, a fourth currency was introduced. However, the victors rightly thought all four was rather too much. They declared the previous three invalid, and quickly installed their currency with much pride.
<br><br>
The people of Manchuria were pleased to be back in a single-currency system. They threw out bills of the previous three, now worthless pieces of paper. I remember seeing money scattered everywhere like pieces of newspaper escaping from their stacks in strong winds. Except to me, money was not something to throw out. I collected them all, running after each bill, and I kept them stacked and packed up tight in an old cardboard box. My mother recalled trying to explain to me that they were no longer valuable, but I understood nothing. To a five year old boy, money was money.
<br><br>
A few weeks later the Chinese Communist Party took back Manchuria from the Chinese National Party. A short while after that, the Russians reclaimed the region. And so on and so on, the change in government kept going; it would change at the rate of every few weeks. 
<br><br>
So all four currencies became valuable again. My mother was very pleased.
