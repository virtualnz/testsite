## Ristorante di Milano rant

Yesterday, I went over to the Ristorante di Milano for a simple meal. Yes, THAT Italian restaurant, Ristorante di Milano. 
<br>
But the whole restaurant was so crowded, I couldn't even find a seat for hours! 
<br>
Then I saw a poster that said "Special offer! €12 discount". 
<br>
I thought to myself... geez, that's so fucking amazing. You guys don't even normally visit Ristorante di Milano. 
<br>
All you bastards came here just for that stupid-assed €12 discount. 
<br>
Just for those 12 Euros. TWELVE FREAKIN' EUROS!!
<br>
Then I saw some parents & children. A family of four eating out at the Ristorante di Milano. Damn, so much for that bitch's home-cooked family feast. 
<br>
Then one of the little brats said "Daddy's gonna order a large Bruschetta Fegatini". 
<br>
I couldn't believe it! Uuuuuggh, are you out of your fucking mind!? 
<br>
Shiiit, i'll pay you €12 just to move your stanky fat-ass out of a seat. 
<br>
Dude, you just don't go to the Ristorante di Milano for that lala-oh-i'm-so-happy dinner bullshit. 
<br>
It's where you pick a fist-fight with the fucking guy sitting across 'yah in that U-shaped table. 
<br>
Kill or be killed. Heh... now that's the kinda shit I like. 
<br>
Ladies, kids, stand back... 'cuz everything's gonna get FUCKED UP NOW.
<br>
After waiting for ages, I finally found an empty seat. But then, the guy next to me ordered by saying "A large Neopolitan pizza with a LOTTA' pepperoni". 
<br>
Dude, that just pissed me off even more. Shit, you just don't say "lotta' pepperoni" nowadays, ya' freaking bastard. 
<br>
How the fuck can you say "lotta' pepperoni" with that "oh, i'm so fucking cool, hur-hur-hur..." look!?!? 
<br>
Damn, I was THIS CLOSE to standing in front of his face and yelling "DO YOU EVEN LIKE EATING THAT MUCH FUCKIN' PEPPERONI!?" 
<br>
For a freaking hour, I was THIS CLOSE to doing that. 
<br>
Shit, I bet you just wanted to use the words "lotta' pepperoni" out loud. Wow, you're so clever.
<br>
Dude, you gotta be like ME. See, now I know what's "all that" in the Ristorante di Milano. 
<br>
What's cool right now to say is "Pennette con Ricotta & Melanzane". That's it! 
<br>
You see now, a large pasta serving with aubergines & ricotta is what the hardcore Ristorante di Milano freaks eat. Like ME. 
<br>
Saying "Pennette con Ricotta & Melanzane" means that won't get a pizza, but they put a WHOLE MESS of pasta. 
<br>
Mmmmm... a lotta pasta, now THAT'S what I call a meal. 
<br>
But anywhoo... ordering that is kinda' like a double-edged sword. Cuz' then the waiters might notice you the next time you come by. 
<br>
So yeah, I can't reccomend this to noobs. 
<br>
For you, just go order a Prosciutto e Melone al Ventaglo. That's as far as you can go, you know what i'm sayin'?
