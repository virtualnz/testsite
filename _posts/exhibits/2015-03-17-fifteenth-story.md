## A bear named Groovy Banana Jay

i dont know what to say now so ill do my best to tell you a story.
<br>
once upon a time there was this bear who wanted to make friends with a tree. he talked and talked to the tree but the tree hated him so he ignored the bear and he got really sad so one day he forced the tree to talk to him. he did this by creating a speaker that spoke for him. 
<br>
woooooow im bad at stories
<br>
the bear then threw the speaker away cause it was a terrible idea and shouldnt have been brought up in the first place, lets name the bear...... bob? samuel? groovy banna jay? groovy banana jay it is. one day groovy banana jay 'blues skadooded' into the trree. (blues skadooded is a blues clues reference) into the tree. 
<br>
it wa here that he discovered a magical, most wondrous world of candy floss! there were candy floss trees.... ironic that a tree created a tree... there were candy floss benches and houses, even candy floss citizens  groovy banana jay then went out and ate the whole candy floss town. he destroyed the town and everyone in it. but after such a scrumptious and extremely unhealthy meal he realised he needed the toilet and ended his day taking a dump in a candy floss
toilet
<br>
that is me in a nutshell
