## Everything is completely silent

Everything is completely silent like a void. No sound, no light. The only thing there is the mysterious sound of a ticking clock. Does it exist? Am I going insane? What is this noise? It is 4 times faster, every quarter of a second. Is time really passing at this pace? Passing faster that I have always believed? Where am I? I am thinking of nothing, my mind is blank, all that is existing is the ticking noise of the clock that is faster than time. I am at peace, absolute tranquility. Is this insanity? Have I fallen victim to the madness? If this is insanity why didn't I loose my mind earlier?
